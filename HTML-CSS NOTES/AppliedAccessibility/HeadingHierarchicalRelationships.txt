<--------------------Heading Hierarchical Relationships-------------------->

Browsers and people use heading tags as a way to indicate the relationship of
the information on a website.

When new information is given in a section then a lower(bigger) heading tag
should be used. When a higher(smaller) heading tag is used it indicates that the
information follows the previous parent heading

//NOTE: Heading tag should only be changed once each time, if a different size
is needed then CSS should be used to modify it.
